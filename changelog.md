## Releases

#### 1.0.17 (2025-08-05)

- toc: Added interface `110200`

#### 1.0.16 (2025-06-18)

- toc: Added `AllowAddOnTableAccess: 1`
- toc: Bumped Interface to `110107`

#### 1.0.15 (2025-04-23)

- toc bump to 110105.
    - Seems to work fine, but not done many tests.
    - But let’s face it, get over yourself and tick that damn “Load out of date AddOns” checkbox. This (i.e not ticking this) is a 100% hypocritical assessment. If an addon author isn’t in the mood to do big revisions, he will just bump that toc number anyway. And you’ll end up with the errors, with or w/o checkbox. That’s what hypocritical means (in this context).
    - Blizz could introduce a real check, that is, checking against some crucial API changes in the last release. This would not cost much (but a bit more than now), but yeah it’s Blizz, only the most cheapest and rotten and fake for us customers.
    
#### 1.0.14 (2025-02-26)

- Added category to toc.
- toc bump to 110100.

#### 1.0.13 (2024-12-19)

- toc bump to 110007 (WoW Retail 11.0.7).
- No content changes. If I notice that the addon needs an update for 11.0.7, I will release one.
- I currently do not have much time to play, so if you notice weird/unusual behavior with 11.0.7 and don’t see an update from my part, please let me know [here](https://github.com/tflo/Action-Bar-Button-Growth-Direction/issues).
- Minor ReadMe changes.

#### 1.0.12 (2024-10-23)

- toc bump, docs.
- No content changes.

#### 1.0.11 (2024-07-24)

- Seems to work fine with TWW 110000; further tests will follow.
- On first launch with 110000, I had to re-enable my action bars in the client settings. Probably this is not related to the addon, not sure though.
- toc updated for TWW 110000.

#### 1.0.10 (2024-05-08)

- toc bump only (100207). Addon update will follow as needed.

#### 1.0.9 (2024-03-19)

- toc bump only. If necessary, the addon will be updated in the next days.

#### 1.0.8 (2024-01-16)

- Just a toc bump for 10.2.5. Compatibility update will follow if needed.

#### 1.0.7 (2023-11-08)

-toc update 100200; no content changes.

#### 1.0.6 (2023-09-06)

- toc bump 100107.
- Minor changes to the Readme.

#### 1.0.5 (2023-07-12)

- Readme improved.

#### 1.0.4 (2023-07-12)

- toc updated for 10.1.5.
  - I have not yet had a chance to really test the addon with 10.1.5. There is a small chance that some of the API changes may affect the addon. If I find any problems, you'll get a content update soon.

#### 1.0.3 (2023-05-27)

- Improved icon.
- Changed readme text so that it will render more or less correctly with CurseForge’s broken MD renderer, as well as with non broken MD renderers, e.g. GitHub, or everything else that is not CurseForge. They (Overwolf) really should get the formatting on their pages fixed. Getting tired of this.

#### 1.0.2 (2023-05-24)

- Added icon for the addon list.

#### 1.0.1 (2023-05-24)

- Fixed CF ID in toc.

#### 1.0 (2023-05-24)

- Initial CurseForge upload.
